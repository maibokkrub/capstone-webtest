# Brief info found at

#
# lookup: The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
# connect: The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
# appconnect: The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host was completed. (Added in 7.19.0)
# pretransfer: The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the file transfer was just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
# redirect: The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before the final transaction was started. time_redirect shows the complete execution time for multiple redirections. (Added in 7.12.3)
# starttransfer: The time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte was just about to be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.
# total: The total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted. The time will be displayed with millisecond resolution.
